            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_2"}>Small dreams and big plans</span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_3"}>SMARTSHOP is the largest online retailer in the country. Since 2005, we have been fulfilling the small dreams and grandiose plans of millions of people. We can find literally everything. We sell at a fair price and provide a guarantee, as we believe that online shopping should be as convenient and safe as possible. And every time someone clicks "Buy", we understand that we are doing the right thing.</span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_2"}>Our goal is to be helpful</span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_3"}>We believe that things exist in order to make life easier, more pleasant and kinder. Therefore, the search for that very thing should be fast, convenient and enjoyable. We don't just sell home appliances, electronics, jewelry or wine. We help you find exactly what you need, in one place and without unnecessary worries, so that you do not waste your life searching, but just live happily. Rozetka is a universal answer to any request, the beginning of the search and its final stop, a real helper. We forever save our customers from unpleasant compromises, fulfill wishes and allow them to dream more boldly. Through smart research and honest service, we're making our customers' lives a little better right now.</span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_2"}>Happiness starts with simple things </span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_3"}>And we help to find these things: we suggest to lovers how to surprise each other; sports motivate never to give up and progress faster; economic we give the opportunity to create real comfort. We want you to know what you are looking for and be able to justify your choice. To do this, we shoot video reviews, write articles and keep track of new items.</span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_2"}>Convenient delivery</span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_3"}>And of course, any product can be ordered with delivery. We deliver in Kyiv within one day, and in Ukraine - the next day. Everything - without prepayment, if necessary - on credit. Payment in cash or non-cash - as you prefer.</span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_2"}>Further more</span>
            <span className={"aboutClassSpan_3"}>We want our customers to never have the question “where to find something they need”. Therefore, now we are not only the largest online retailer, but also a platform for sellers. Someone will start their first business with us (or expand an existing one), and someone will bring products to Ukraine that are not yet available. This is beneficial to everyone: both buyers and sellers, and even us - because in this way we will help more people become a little happier.</span>
